# Example for demonstrating a problem in rc-dock

See https://github.com/ticlo/rc-dock/issues/159

Clone repository, then do

```
npm ci
npm run dev
```

This should start a dev server on some local port, point your browser there.

Now try dragging the left panel (Not the tab!!) over to the "bottom" position of the right panel.
